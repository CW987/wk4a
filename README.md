External issues with GIT and Hardware 
Interim solution is to borrow partners mac for now and save for a Mac mini.
Git issues seemed to be related to the hardware issue. Git status is my new best friend. 
Initial setup was straightforward once hardware and GIT issues were resolved. Only there is a mental block compared to yesterday before I downed tools. Trello is keeping me *doing* things, I am making the bits of the jigsaw Iâ€™m just not confident it will go together.
My older code was much more useful this time around, especially for the form. I barely recognised my own code, but it took the stress out of what I was searching for.
